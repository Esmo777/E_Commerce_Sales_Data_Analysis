- Data cleaning and transformation
- SQL analysis using MySQL Workbench
- Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI
- Business reporting and presentation (Gamma PPT)

Dataset

- Type: E-commerce sales data
- Content:
  . Product information
  . Categories
  . Sales, profit, and time variables
- Granularity: Monthly sales records
- Purpose: Analyze sales performance, profitability, and product trends

Tools & Technologies
